Read install.sh
The script is simple you can modify it and bend it to your needs quickly.
I wrote it is intentionally in not a not DRY functions fashion
So it will by straight forward. I think you will be able fairly easily  
reconstruct this script in to a script of your needs.



plan:

all hosted on 127.0.0.1 one shard "s1"

mongod servers replica set "s1": web0:27018,web0:27020,web0:27021
config servers:                  web0:27019,web0:27119,web0:27219
mongos router:                   web0:27017

please note: this script doesn't configure how to shard a database
             if you need it later you can do it yourself
