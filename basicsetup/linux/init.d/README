Mongodb Quick Installation Script

  1. change ip binding to your likening in files:  , the ip can be several separated by comma
       mongodbs1r1
       mongodbs1r2
       mongodbs1r3
       mongodbconfigdb
       mongodbconfigdb2
       mongodbconfigdb3
       mongos
  2. validate your /etc/hosts file
     that it contains your hostname as a name not localhost
     for example:

Read install.sh
The script is simple you can modify it and bend it to your needs quickly.
I wrote it intentionally in a not DRY functions fashion
So it will be straight forward. I think you will be able fairly easily  
reconstruct this script in to a script of your needs.



plan:

all hosted on 127.0.0.1 one shard "s1"

mongod servers replica set "s1": web0:27018,web0:27020,web0:27021
config servers:                  web0:27019,web0:27119,web0:27219
mongos router:                   web0:27017

please note: this script doesn't configure how to shard a database
             if you need it later you can do it yourself 


This is a basic configuration and it is not much stable
To make it stable spread the parts to different computers.
A more stable configuration is like:

mongod servers replica set "s1": web0:27018,web0:27020-arbiter,web1:27018,web1:27020-arbiter
config servers:                  web0:27019,web1:27019,web0:27119
mongos router:                   web0:27017
